## Background

In this exercise, you will perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using publicly available genotype and phenotype data from rice (*Oryza sativa*).
This module introduces you to:
- Population structure analysis using PCA
- GWAS using the rrBLUP package
- Visualization of associations (Manhattan and QQ plots)
- Identification of significant SNPs and export of results

The trait of interest is flowering time in Arkansas, one of 34 measured phenotypes in this dataset.

## 0. Install (if needed) and load required packages

If you have not installed the required packages, uncomment the lines below to install them. Otherwise, you can skip this step and just load the packages using the `library()` function.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
#  install.packages("BiocManager")
# 
# install.packages("rrBLUP")
# install.packages("BGLR")
# BiocManager::install("SNPRelate")
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("qqman")
# install.packages("poolr")
```


Load the packages:

```{r}
library(rrBLUP)
library(BGLR)
library(SNPRelate)
library(dplyr)
library(qqman)
library(poolr)
```

### 1. Data loading

We will use publicly available genotype and phenotype data from 413 accessions of *Oryza sativa* (rice) available from http://ricediversity.org/data/index.cfm. This includes data for 44,100 SNPs from 413 accessions with 34 phenotypic traits.

**Input Files:**
- `sativas413.ped`: Genotype matrix in PLINK format.
- `sativas413.fam`: Sample metadata (used for matching individuals).
- `sativas413.map`: SNP information (chromosome, ID, position).
- `RiceDiversity_44K_Phenotypes_34traits_PLINK.txt`: Trait data for 34 phenotypes.

```{r}

# Read the genotype data from the .ped file using a helper function.
Geno <- read_ped("sativas413.ped")
p = Geno$p         # Number of SNPs
n = Geno$n         # Number of samples
Geno = Geno$x      # Extract genotype matrix

# Read metadata for samples and SNPs
FAM <- read.table("sativas413.fam")  # Accession (sample) information
MAP <- read.table("sativas413.map")  # SNP mapping information (chr, ID, pos)

# Recode genotype values for compatibility:
# PLINK coding: 0 = homozygous reference, 1 = heterozygous, 3 = homozygous alt, 2 = missing
Geno[Geno == 2] <- NA  # Missing data becomes NA
Geno[Geno == 0] <- 0   # Homozygous reference stays 0
Geno[Geno == 1] <- 1   # Heterozygous stays 1
Geno[Geno == 3] <- 2   # Homozygous alt becomes 2

# Reshape genotype vector into a p × n matrix (SNPs × samples)
Geno <- matrix(Geno, nrow = p, ncol = n, byrow = TRUE)

# Transpose so rows = samples, columns = SNPs (standard for GWAS)
Geno <- t(Geno)

# Check resulting dimensions
dim(Geno)

# Read phenotype data from URL
rice.pheno <- read.table(
  "http://www.ricediversity.org/data/sets/44kgwas/RiceDiversity_44K_Phenotypes_34traits_PLINK.txt",
  header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t"
)

# View first few rows and columns of the phenotype data
rice.pheno[1:5, 1:5]
dim(rice.pheno)
```

### 2. Data processing

For processing the data we will filter our SNP dataset, and match the genetic and phenotypic data. We will focus our analysis in only one trait: the flowering time in Arkansas.

First we select the variables of interest.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Assign sample IDs to genotype matrix rows
rownames(Geno) <- FAM$V2

# Match sample IDs across phenotype and genotype
matched_ids <- intersect(rownames(Geno), rice.pheno$NSFTVID)

# Subset both matrices to only include matched samples
Geno <- Geno[matched_ids, ]
rice.pheno.sub <- rice.pheno[match(matched_ids, rice.pheno$NSFTVID), ]

# Extract the target trait: Flowering time in Arkansas
y <- matrix(rice.pheno.sub$Flowering.time.at.Arkansas, ncol = 1)
rownames(y) <- rice.pheno.sub$NSFTVID

# Filter out samples with missing phenotype values
valid_idx <- which(!is.na(y))
Geno <- Geno[valid_idx, ]
y <- y[valid_idx, , drop = FALSE]

# Impute missing genotype values using column means
Geno <- apply(Geno, 2, function(col) ifelse(is.na(col), mean(col, na.rm = TRUE), col))

```

SNPs with low minor allele frequencies (e.g., <5%) may lead to unstable association estimates. 
We filter out these SNPs from both the genotype and SNP metadata.

```{r}
# Calculate allele frequencies:
# Each SNP's total allele count is divided by 2 × number of individuals (diploid)
p <- colSums(Geno) / (2 * nrow(Geno))

# Compute Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) for each SNP
# If p > 0.5 (i.e., major allele freq), subtract from 1 to get minor allele freq
maf <- ifelse(p > 0.5, 1 - p, p)

# Identify SNPs with MAF < 0.05 (i.e., low-frequency variants)
# These are typically removed to avoid unstable statistical estimates
maf.index <- which(maf < 0.05)

# Remove low-MAF SNPs from genotype matrix
Geno1 <- Geno[, -maf.index]
dim(Geno1)  # Dimensions after filtering

# Reload SNP map data to filter it the same way
MAP <- read.table("sativas413.map")
dim(MAP)

# Remove corresponding SNPs from the map file
MAP1 <- MAP[-maf.index, ]
dim(MAP1)
```

Finally, we combine our data into a genome data structure (GDS) object.
SNPRelate uses GDS (Genomic Data Structure) to efficiently store and access large-scale genotype data.
This allows fast computation of PCA, IBD, and LD pruning, especially for genome-wide datasets.

```{r}
# Convert genotype matrix to standard R matrix format
Geno1 <- as.matrix(Geno1)

# Extract sample IDs from row names
sample <- row.names(Geno1)
length(sample)  # Should equal number of individuals

# Select a subset of SNPs for faster processing (e.g., 5,888 SNPs)
# PCA and GDS creation are computationally expensive, so we limit the number
Geno2 <- Geno1[, 1:5888]
MAP2 <- MAP1[1:5888, ]  # Subset the SNP metadata to match

# Assign SNP IDs to column names
colnames(Geno2) <- MAP2$V2  # SNP IDs from MAP file
snp.id <- colnames(Geno2)
length(snp.id)

# Create a GDS (Genomic Data Structure) file
# This is a binary file format optimized for scalable analysis in SNPRelate
# Arguments:
# - genmat: genotype matrix
# - sample.id: sample names
# - snp.id: SNP names
# - snp.chromosome: chromosome number
# - snp.position: base-pair position
# - snpfirstdim = FALSE means SNPs are columns (default layout)
snpgdsCreateGeno(
  "44k.gds",
  genmat = Geno2,
  sample.id = sample,
  snp.id = snp.id,
  snp.chromosome = MAP2$V1,
  snp.position = MAP2$V4,
  snpfirstdim = FALSE
)

# Open the newly created GDS file
geno_44k <- snpgdsOpen("44k.gds")

# Print a summary of the GDS file contents (samples, SNPs, chromosomes, etc.)
snpgdsSummary("44k.gds")

```


### 3. Perform the analyses

First, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the SNPRelate package.
This identifies population structure based on genetic similarity.

```{r}

# - We specify the SNPs used by giving colnames(Geno2)
pca_result <- snpgdsPCA(geno_44k, snp.id = colnames(Geno2))

# Create a data frame with the top 4 eigenvectors (principal components)
# These represent axes of genetic variation
pca <- data.frame(
  sample.id = row.names(Geno2),
  EV1 = pca_result$eigenvect[, 1],
  EV2 = pca_result$eigenvect[, 2],
  EV3 = pca_result$eigenvect[, 3],
  EV4 = pca_result$eigenvect[, 4],
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Plot samples in PCA space using the first two components
# Clustering in the plot may reflect population structure or relatedness
plot(pca$EV2, pca$EV1, xlab = "eigenvector 1", ylab = "eigenvector 2")

```

> How are the genotypes of *O. sativa* structured? Do you see any clustering?



Then we run the GWAS using the rrBLUP package.

```{r}
# Prepare genotype data for input to the rrBLUP::GWAS() function
# - MAP2 contains SNP metadata: [1] chromosome, [2] SNP ID, [4] base-pair position
# - Geno2 has genotype values coded as 0, 1, 2 (allele dosage)
#   rrBLUP expects values coded as -1 (homozygous ref), 0 (heterozygous), 1 (homozygous alt),
#   so we subtract 1 from each value before transposing
geno_final <- data.frame(
  marker = MAP2[, 2],
  chrom = MAP2[, 1],
  pos = MAP2[, 4],
  t(Geno2 - 1),  # Recode and transpose so SNPs are rows and samples are columns
  check.names = FALSE
)

dim(Geno2)  # Confirm dimensions of genotype data before transformation

# Prepare phenotype data
# - The phenotype must be in a data frame with one column matching sample IDs
pheno_final <- data.frame(NSFTV_ID = rownames(y), y = y)

# Run GWAS using the rrBLUP package
# - min.MAF: filters SNPs with low minor allele frequency (<5%)
# - P3D = TRUE: enables faster computation using pre-estimated variance components
# - plot = FALSE: suppress default plotting
GWAS <- GWAS(pheno_final, geno_final, min.MAF = 0.05, P3D = TRUE, plot = FALSE)

# Estimate the effective p-value threshold for multiple testing correction
# This is an approximate method assuming ~434 independent tests
# (NOTE: This line approximates a Bonferroni-like threshold but isn't standard)
p_threshold = (1 - (1 - 0.05))^1/434
p_threshold

# Clean up the GWAS results:
# Some rows may have character "0" in the 'y' column (likely placeholder or error flag)
# Filter them out before plotting or interpretation
GWAS_1 <- GWAS %>% filter(y != "0")

# Generate a QQ plot to check for inflation or deflation of p-values
qq(GWAS_1$y, main = "QQ Plot of GWAS P-values")
```

### 4. Visualize the results

We can now identify which loci are significantly associated with the flowering time in Arkansas.
A Manhattan plot is a standard way to visualize GWAS results.
Each dot represents a SNP, and the y-axis shows statistical significance.
Peaks above the threshold suggest regions of the genome potentially associated with the trait.

```{r}
# View the list of SNPs with p-values below a chosen significance threshold
# These SNPs are considered significantly associated with the trait of interest (flowering time in Arkansas)
# We use a threshold of 1e-4 (0.0001) here for demonstration, though more stringent thresholds may be needed
GWAS_1 %>% filter(y < 1e-04)

# Export significant SNPs to CSV
significant_snps <- GWAS_1 %>% filter(y < 1e-04)
write.csv(significant_snps, "significant_snps_flowering_time.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Create a Manhattan plot to visualize GWAS results
# - Each point is a SNP
# - X-axis: Chromosomal position
# - Y-axis: -log10(p-value), so more significant SNPs appear higher on the plot
# - SNPs are colored by chromosome for visual clarity
# - suggestiveline: horizontal line at -log10(1e-4) to highlight significant associations

manhattan(
  x = GWAS_1,
  chr = "chrom",       # Chromosome column
  bp = "pos",          # Base pair position
  p = "y",             # P-value column (stored as 'y' from rrBLUP::GWAS)
  snp = "marker",      # SNP ID
  col = c("blue4", "orange3"),  # Alternating colors by chromosome
  suggestiveline = -log10(1e-04),
  logp = TRUE          # Plot -log10(p-value) instead of raw p-values
)


```


### Back to the Biology
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow us to connect variation in genotype with variation in phenotype. In this case, you explored associations between SNP markers and flowering time in *Oryza sativa* (rice), an agriculturally important trait.

Reflect on the following questions:

> Were there SNPs significantly associated with flowering time in Arkansas?

> Do the top hits cluster in specific chromosomal regions?

> How might these associations inform our understanding of flowering time regulation in rice?

> Did the PCA plot suggest underlying genetic substructure in the rice population?

> How might rice breeders use this type of information to guide selection?

> How many SNPs showed strong association with flowering time at the Arkansas site?

> What additional steps would you take to validate these associations biologically (e.g., expression studies, CRISPR validation, linkage mapping, ATAC-Seq, RNA-Seq, eQTL)?

GWAS is a powerful hypothesis-generating tool, but the results need to be interpreted in the context of biological function and validated through additional experiments.

The significant SNPs you identified could be candidates for further investigation into the genetic control of flowering time in rice.
