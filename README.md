# BIO543 â€“ R Exercises (Summer 2025)

This repository contains ungraded R exercises and data files for the course *BIO543: Molecular Genetics and Genomics* (Summer 2025, ASU). These materials are designed to accompany weekly modules and support learning basic R skills in a genomics context.

**Note:** This repository does not include any graded assignments or exams.

Each module folder includes:
- A pre-written `.Rmd` script
- A dataset for practice
- Occasionally a scaffolded `functions.R` script for building modular code

Students are expected to download, run, and explore these scripts in RStudio.

## Acknowledgments

Many of the R exercises and templates in this repository were originally developed by [Raul Araya Donoso](https://github.com/raularayad) during the Spring 2025 semester of BIO 543. They are used here with permission and have been adapted for the Summer 2025 session.
