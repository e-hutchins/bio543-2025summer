# Module 3.8: R Exercise â€“ RNA-seq Differential Expression in Fruit Fly Development

This folder contains the R exercise for Module 3.8 in BIO 543 (Summer 2025):  
**"R exercise: RNASeq â€“ Differential Expression in *Drosophila melanogaster***"

## ðŸ§ª Overview

In this exercise, youâ€™ll analyze RNA-seq count data from fruit fly (*Drosophila*) larvae at different developmental stages (L1 vs L2) using the DESeq2 package in R. You will:
- Load and inspect count and phenotype data
- Run a differential expression analysis
- Visualize results (MA plot, volcano plot, heatmap)
- Identify top genes and explore their expression
- Interpret biological meaning in the context of gene regulation

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `module3_exercise.Rmd` â€“ R Markdown file for the exercise
- `Module_3-8_data.zip` â€“ zipped archive containing the following files:
  - `modencodefly_count_table.txt` â€“ RNA-seq count data
  - `modencodefly_phenodata.txt` â€“ sample metadata

## ðŸ“¥ Instructions

1. **Download and unzip** the file `Module_3-8_data.zip`.

2. Place the two unzipped files in the **same folder** as the R Markdown file:

3. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.

4. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder containing all three files. You can check this in R with:
```r
getwd()
```

5. Knit the document or run the code chunks interactively.

The .Rmd script includes a check that will stop with an error message if the required data files arenâ€™t found in the same folder.
