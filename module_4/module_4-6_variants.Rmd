## Background

In this module, we examine genetic variation across multiple samples of *Phytophthora infestans*, the organism responsible for late potato blight. These variants were identified using high-throughput sequencing and are stored in a VCF (variant call format) file. By combining the variants with sequence and annotation data, we can visualize and interpret genomic regions of interest.

Variant filtering and visualization are common first steps in population genomics, functional genomics, and medical genetics pipelines. This exercise walks through those steps using `vcfR`.



## 0. Install (if needed) and Load Required Packages

If this is your first time running this, uncomment and run the install lines:

```{r}
# install.packages("vcfR")
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("ape")
```

Then load the packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(vcfR)   # for reading and processing VCF files
library(dplyr)  # for data manipulation
library(ape)    # for reading DNA sequences
```



## 1. Load Data from the pinfsc50 Dataset

We will use a test dataset provided with the `vcfR` package that includes variant calls, genome sequence, and annotation.

```{r}
pkg <- "pinfsc50"

vcf_file <- system.file("extdata", "pinf_sc50.vcf.gz", package = pkg)
dna_file <- system.file("extdata", "pinf_sc50.fasta", package = pkg)
gff_file <- system.file("extdata", "pinf_sc50.gff", package = pkg)

vcf <- read.vcfR(vcf_file, verbose = FALSE)
dna <- read.dna(dna_file, format = "fasta")
gff <- read.table(gff_file, sep = "\t", quote = "")
```



## 2. Create and Process a chromR Object

The `chromR` object integrates variant data (VCF), sequence data (FASTA), and annotations (GFF).

```{r, message=FALSE}
chrom <- create.chromR(name = "Supercontig", vcf = vcf, seq = dna, ann = gff)
chrom <- proc.chromR(chrom, verbose = TRUE)

# Visualize quality summaries across the chromosome
plot(chrom)
```

### Plot Interpretation:
> Describe what is being visualized in this plot. Which metric or summary is most informative for quality control?



## 3. Visualize the Variant Landscape

Use the `chromoqc()` function to explore the distribution of depth and quality scores.

```{r}
chromoqc(chrom, dp.alpha = 20)
```

### Plot Interpretation:
> Do you observe any unusual regions in terms of sequencing depth or quality? Describe them briefly.



## 4. Mask Low-Quality Variants

Apply thresholds to remove poorly supported variants (aka "masking").

```{r, message=FALSE}
chrom <- masker(chrom, min_QUAL = 1, min_DP = 300, max_DP = 700, 
                min_MQ = 59.9, max_MQ = 60.1)
chrom <- proc.chromR(chrom, verbose = TRUE)
chromoqc(chrom, dp.alpha = 20)
```

### Plot Interpretation:
> What changed in the variant profile after masking?



## 5. Zoom into a Region of Interest

First, zoom into the high-density region between 200,000 and 300,000 bp:

```{r}
chromoqc(chrom, xlim = c(200000, 300000))
```

### Plot Interpretation:
> What do you observe in this region?

Now, try zooming in on a different region (e.g., 100,000 to 200,000 bp):

```{r}
chromoqc(chrom, xlim = c(100000, 200000))
```

### Plot Interpretation:
> How does this region compare in terms of variant density and quality to the previous region?



## 6. Identify Genes in These Regions

### Finding Gene Names from GFF Attributes
```{r}
# Extract name and ID from the GFF attributes column,
# and add these as columns in the gff object
gff$gene_name <- sub(".*NAME=([^;]+);.*", "\\1", gff$V9)
gff$gene_id <- sub(".*ID=([^;]+).*", "\\1", gff$V9)

# Show a few examples with head()
head(gff[, c("gene_name", "gene_id")])

```

### Example: Genes between 200,000 and 300,000 bp

```{r}
gff_zoom <- filter(gff, V5 < 300000 & V4 > 200000)
head(gff_zoom[, c("V1", "V4", "V5", "gene_name")])

#list unique gene names in this region
unique(gff_zoom$gene_name)
```

> How many genes are in this region? Use columns V4 (start) and V5 (end) to describe the position of one or two genes.

### Now try: Genes between 100,000 and 200,000 bp

```{r}
gff_other <- filter(gff, V5 < 200000 & V4 > 100000)
head(gff_other[, c("V1", "V4", "V5", "gene_name")])

#list unique gene names in this region
unique(gff_other$gene_name)
```

> Are there more or fewer genes in this region compared to 200–300 kb?

### Interpretation Note:
In this fungal dataset, genes are identified using internal protein names (like "histone chaperone ASF1-like protein") and locus IDs (like "PITG_17091").

On the exam, you’ll use the same strategy: filter the annotation file by region and extract gene info. However, in a human genome dataset, the names will look more familiar:

Official gene symbols like LFNG

Ensembl IDs like ENSG00000106003

The process is the same: zoom in, filter, and extract.




## 7. Back to the Biology

> If this analysis were part of a plant pathology study, what follow-up experiments could be performed on the genes identified in a region with many variants?

> How could this type of workflow (variant filtering + annotation) be applied in other species or research areas?




## Optional Challenge

Try modifying the `masker()` thresholds:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Example: Lower minimum depth to 100
chrom <- masker(chrom, min_QUAL = 1, min_DP = 100, max_DP = 700,
                min_MQ = 59.9, max_MQ = 60.1)
chrom <- proc.chromR(chrom)
chromoqc(chrom, dp.alpha = 20)
```

> What do you notice? How does adjusting thresholds affect which variants remain?
